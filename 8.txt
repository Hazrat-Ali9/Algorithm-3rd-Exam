 In a recursive function, the recursive case is the part of the function that calls itself to solve a subproblem. The recursive case is where the function makes a recursive call and divides the problem into smaller sub-problems. These smaller sub-problems should be simpler or smaller than the original problem. In other words, the recursive case defines the recursion and how the function will keep calling itself until it reaches the base case.

The base case is a stopping condition that tells the recursive function when to stop calling itself and return a value. The base case is the simplest form of the problem that can be solved directly without calling the function again. It is an essential part of a recursive function because without it, the function would keep calling itself indefinitely, leading to infinite recursion.

The recursive case and the base case are related in that they work together to solve a problem using recursion. The recursive case breaks down the problem into smaller sub- problems until it reaches the base case, which solves the problem directly. The base case is necessary to stop the recursion and return a value. The recursive case is necessary to break down the problem into smaller subproblems until the base case can be reached.
