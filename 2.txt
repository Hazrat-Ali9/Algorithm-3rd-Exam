       There are several ways to represent a graph, including:

                                                                        1. Adjacency Matrix:
An adjacency matrix is a two-dimensional array that stores information about the edges of a graph. The element at row i and column j represents the presence or absence of an edge between vertex i and vertex j. For an undirected graph, the matrix is symmetric along the diagonal. For example, consider the following undirected graph:

Example: 
 1 â€”- 2
|    |
3 -- 4
The corresponding adjacency matrix would be:
   | 1 2 3 4
---+--------
 1 | 0 1 1 0
 2 | 1 0 0 1
 3 | 1 0 0 1
 4 | 0 1 1 0

                                                                                2. Adjacency List:
An adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists, where each list represents the set of neighbors of a vertex in a graph. For example, the adjacency list for the above graph would be:

1: 2, 3
2: 1, 4
3: 1, 4
4: 2, 3

                                                                                       3. Edge List:
An edge list is a collection of all the edges in a graph, represented as pairs of vertices. For example, the edge list for the above graph would be:

(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4)
